Card Deck Manager
Shuffle cards securely
Deal cards to players and community
Timer System
Time limits for player actions
Auto-actions when time expires (fold or check)

Update UI based on game state changes
Enable/disable appropriate actions
6. First Implementation Steps
Remove blinds/time component from cash game UI
Create game initialization function when player joins table
Implement basic player actions (check, bet, fold)
Add stand functionality to exit the game
Setup local game state structure
Connect PokerControl component to game actions
